## My process
I initiated the project by carefully reviewing the provided readme notes to gain a comprehensive understanding of the requirements. To ensure visual consistency and aesthetic appeal, I proceeded to install the specified fonts tailored for this project.

Next, I focused on structuring the project. Initially, I conceptualized the layout in my mind, carefully considering design principles and user experience. Subsequently, I meticulously translated this conceptualization into a tangible structure, aligning it with the design specifications provided in the accompanying images
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This project provided a valuable opportunity for learning and growth, particularly in refining my understanding of CSS pseudo-classes. The challenges encountered and overcome during this endeavor have served as a catalyst for inspiration, prompting me to embark on the creation of my own portfolio. Reflecting on the experience, I find that it has not only expanded my technical skills but has also fueled a newfound enthusiasm for personal projects and professional development.
